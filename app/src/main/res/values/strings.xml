    <string name="about">Foody Tells is a fast food company which believes in total customer satisfaction. We believe that every individual is unique and hence
everyone has their own preferences and taste. We as a company respect that and as a result the company helps its customers to design their
own custom meal through the app. In a way we try to develop a virtual kitchen between the chief and the client so that the client gets
his meal according to his taste.</string>

    <string name="condition">This app is meant only to be an educational purpose project. Hence it does not deliver the product. However, this is a fully functional app which helps
to develop virtual connection between the chief and the client. This app is meant only for education purpose and is not business oriented.</string>

    <string name="me">I am a 21 year old Android developer currently pursuing Computer Science Engineering at LNMIIT Jaipur. A desire to make usable products, learning
technologies and a childhood love for maths makes me work harder for my goals in the fast developing world of Computer Science.</string>
